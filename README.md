# RHI — Simplified PC Gaming

> **中文用户**：本仓库 fork 自上游 [RankFTW/RHI](https://github.com/RankFTW/RHI)，汉化版本请见 [README_zh-CN.md](README_zh-CN.md)。

One app to manage HDR mods across your entire PC game library. RHI auto-detects games from eight storefronts, installs and updates ReShade, RenoDX, frame limiters, DLSS/Streamline, OptiScaler, and more — all with per-game control and zero manual configuration.

> **⚠ Single-player only.** RHI installs ReShade with addon support, which may trigger anti-cheat in online games. Uninstall before playing multiplayer.

## Why RHI?

- **8-store detection** — Steam, GOG, Epic, EA App, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox/Game Pass, Battle.net, Rockstar. No manual setup.
- **10 managed components** — ReShade, RenoDX, RenoDX Upgrade, ReLimiter, Display Commander, OptiScaler, RE Framework, Luma Framework, DXVK, DOF Fix. One-click install, update, and removal for each.
- **46 shader packs** — RHI Managed (built-in packs), Custom (your own shaders), or Off (no shader deployment). Global or per-game. Per-file selection lets you tick only the individual shaders you want. Save, load, and share named shader profiles — export to a zip and paste into Discord.
- **Generic Luma for all DX11 UE games** — every DX11 Unreal Engine game in your library gets a Luma row. Game-specific Engine.ini tweaks and launch args are applied automatically on install.
- **DLSS & Streamline management** — swap SR, Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation independently. Update or downgrade Streamline as a set. Per-game DLSS presets without NVIDIA Profile Inspector.
- **Nvidia Profile Overrides** — VSync, Low Latency, Smooth Motion, Power Mode, ReBAR, Multi Frame Generation, DLSS render scale (33–100%). All per-game, written directly to NVIDIA driver profiles.
- **Batch deploy** — update DLSS/Streamline versions and presets across multiple games at once.
- **DLSS & Streamline Defaults** — configure preferred versions, presets, and render scales. One-click Quick Apply per game.
- **Profile Export/Import** — back up all per-game NVIDIA profile settings to JSON. Restore after driver updates.
- **Drag-and-drop** — drop an exe, addon, preset, Luma archive, or URL. RHI figures out what to do.
- **Two view modes** — Detail and Compact. Toggle between them in one click.
- **Game Launch** — Steam uses `-applaunch` (with overlay and playtime tracking), Epic uses its protocol, everything else launches directly. Custom exe and arguments per game.
- **HDR Auto-Toggle** — automatically enables Windows HDR on game launch and disables on exit. Global or per-game. No more manual toggling in Windows Settings.
- **Running game indicator** — sidebar highlights green when a game launched through RHI is running.
- **System Tray & Jump List** — minimize to the system tray on close. Right-click the tray or taskbar icon to launch recent games instantly.
- **Automatic background updates** — all mod and app updates re-checked every 4 hours while running.
- **Custom Addons** — drop `.addon64`/`.addon32` files in the Custom folder. They appear in the Addon Manager with on/off toggles.
- **Digital Vibrance** — per-display color saturation control (0–100) restored automatically on startup.
- **DLSS / Streamline Auto-Update** — games on the latest version are automatically swapped when a new release appears. Manually chosen older versions are left alone.
- **Peak Brightness** — set your monitor's peak nits once, automatically written to all reshade.ini files on every deploy.
- **Luma + RenoDX coexistence** — for compatible games, both frameworks run side by side.
- **Ryubing emulator support** — 9 Switch game addons from Souperman9, downloaded and deployed in one click. Addons self-select which game is running.
- **RTX HDR per-game toggle** — enable NVIDIA's driver-level HDR injection for any game. Configure Peak Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Middle Grey, and Debanding. Requires NVIDIA App with Overlay and Game Filters enabled.
- **Custom ReShade auto-redeploy** — update a custom ReShade DLL in the Custom folder and it's automatically redeployed to all games using it. Checked on Refresh and every 4 hours.
- **Start with Windows** — launch minimized to the system tray on Windows startup.
- **UE-Extended auto-configuration** — reshade.ini `[renodx]` section and Engine.ini HDR settings are written automatically.
- **Nexus Mods update alerts** — GraphQL API, no API key required.
- **Remote manifest** — game-specific fixes pushed over the air without app updates.
- **Foreign DLL protection** — binary signature scanning prevents accidental overwrites of DXVK, Special K, ENB, etc.
- **Addon file watcher** — auto-detects new addons in your Downloads folder and prompts to install.
- **Message of the Day** — important notices delivered on launch when something changes.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Game not detected | **Add Game** in Settings — pick the game's exe and name it |
| Xbox games missing | Click **Refresh** — Game Pass detection may need a moment |
| ReShade not loading | Check the install path via 📁 — the DLL must sit next to the game exe |
| Black screen (Unreal) | ReShade → Add-ons → RenoDX → set `R10G10B10A2_UNORM` to `output size` |
| UE-Extended not working | Enable HDR in the game's display settings first |
| Downloads failing | Click **Refresh**, or clear cache from Settings → Open Downloads Cache |
| DLSS presets not applying | Enable Admin Mode in Settings, or run RHI as administrator |
| Everything out of sync | Settings → **Full Refresh** clears all caches and re-scans |
